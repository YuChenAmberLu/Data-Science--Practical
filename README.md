# Introduction of statistical learning 

#### Introduce initial analysis and statistical learning of datasets in ISLR using R. 
#### There are five questions for you to learn step by step. 

## Question 1 (Introduce regsubsets function)
#### Demonstrate best subsets, forward selection and backwards elimination to identify a great subset of Auto and take in to my statistical model. Auto is a dataset on http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Auto.data

> Best subsets

> Forward selection

> Backwards elimination


## Question 2 (Initial data analysis)
#### Get ideas how to do initial analysis using Boston dataset, which is also a dataset in ISLR.

> How many columns?

> What is the range of each quatitative variables?

> Is there any relation between two variables?

> How many data while given constraints?


## Question 3 (Do statistical learning on binary outcomes)
#### Train Weekly dataset, which is also a dataset in ISLR, using Logistic regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic discriminant analysis, and K - nearest neighbor.

> Logistic regression

> Linear Discriminant Analysis

> Quadratic discriminant analysis

> K - nearest neighbor


## Question 4 (Write a function of linear regression without using 'lm') 
#### Create a function of linear regression on binary outcomes


## Question 5 (Do statistical learning on quantitative data)
#### Train, test, and predict sales, which is set as response among others factors of ads, using linear regression. ads is a dataset on http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Advertising.csv
